## This page will serve as a running collection of all the questions and problems associates may encounter when using Websphere.

### Q: When my Websphere instance is starting, my console outputs a stack trace for a "non-deferrable alarm" thread being returned. What does this impact?
A: These warnings are quite common but do not affect the functionality of the Websphere instance, so they can be ignored for testing code. Eliminating the warning from a housekeeping perspective is another matter.
